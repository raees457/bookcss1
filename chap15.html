    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

    <blockquote class="am">"Life is like riding a bicycle.
     To keep your balance you must keep moving." -

    <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking
     machine that would help him get around the royal

    <div class="body"> 
        <p class="line">The fourth paragraph does not
        go across to the left hand edge
        of the page as one might expect.
        Rather it sits right under the
        third paragraph.
        The reason for this is that the
        fourth paragraph has space to
        start under the third paragraph,
        but it cannot go any further to
        the left because the second
        paragraph is in the way.
        Setting the height of the
        paragraphs to be the same
        height as the tallest paragraph
        would solve this issue, but it
        is rarely suited to real world
        designs where the amount of
        text in a paragraph or column
        may vary. It is more common
        to use the clear property
        (discussed on the next page) to
        solve this issue </p>
